# Latent Consistency LoRAs with BentoML

This project demonstrates how to deploy a REST API server for Stable Diffusion with minimal inference steps. We'll use BentoML to convert [this HuggingFace example](https://huggingface.co/blog/lcm_lora) for Latent Consistency LoRAs.

## Prerequisites

- You have installed Python 3.8+ and `pip`. See the [Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to learn more.
- You have a basic understanding of key concepts in BentoML, such as Services. We recommend you read [Quickstart](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/1.2/get-started/quickstart.html) first.
- (Optional) We recommend you create a virtual environment for dependency isolation for this project. See the [Conda documentation](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) or the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for details.

## Install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bentoml/BentoLCM.git
cd BentoLCM
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the BentoML Service

We have defined a BentoML Service in `service.py`. Run `bentoml serve` in your project directory to start the Service.

```bash
bentoml serve .
```

The server is now active at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/). You can interact with it using the Swagger UI or in other different ways.

CURL

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:3000/txt2img' \
  -H 'accept: image/*' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "prompt": "close-up photography of old man standing in the rain at night, in a street lit by lamps, leica 35mm summilux"
}' -o out.jpg
```

## Deploy to production

After the Service is ready, you can deploy the application to BentoCloud for better management and scalability. A configuration YAML file (`bentofile.yaml`) is used to define the build options for your application. It is used for packaging your application into a Bento. See [Bento build options](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/concepts/bento.html#bento-build-options) to learn more.

Make sure you have [logged in to BentoCloud](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/1.2/bentocloud/how-tos/manage-access-token.html), then run the following command in your project directory to deploy the application to BentoCloud.

```bash
bentoml deploy .
```

Once the application is up and running on BentoCloud, you can access it via the exposed URL.

**Note**: Alternatively, you can use BentoML to generate a [Docker image](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/1.2/guides/containerization.html) for a custom deployment.
